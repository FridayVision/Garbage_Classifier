<h1> Garbage_Classifier </h1>

We have built a CNN model to predict the type of garbage by training it from a set of 6 different classes. <br>
  - cardboard
  - glass
  - metal
  - paper
  - plastic
  - trash  
<br>
 We've used the architecture of Xception Model along with learning rate scheduler and custom callbacks to try and prevent over-fitting.

**Please refer to my kaggle notebook for detailed comments on the code** <br>
